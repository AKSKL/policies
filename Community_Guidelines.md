## Advertising
Do not advertise in our server or to our members. Advertising is defined as sending messages or using other features of Discord in a manner designed to promote something other than community-sponsored projects. If in doubt, ask a moderator before posting.

## Backseat Moderating
Do not "backseat moderate". "Backseat moderating" is defined as acting like or taking on the role of a moderator.

## Behavior and Conduct
Do not disrespect or harass anyone. This includes, but is not limited to, making racist or obscene comments towards other members of the community and using derogatory or vulgar language in a manner that is intended to disrespect or harass another member.

## Impersonation
Do not impersonate any person or group of people. Do not act in a manner that is intended to mislead others into believing that you are someone that you are not. 

## Mentions
Except for the `Support` role, do not mention any role on our server. When mentioning the `Support` role, we ask that you use this ability wisely. Additionally, do not mention other members excessively or mention an excessive number of members in a short period of time.

## Bugs
Do not intentionally exploit bugs or issues with Discord or any of the bots on our server. Knowingly exploiting bugs in Discord or any of our bots in order to cause harm will result in a permanent ban from our community.

## Spam
Do not post spam. Our definition of "spam" includes unsolicited advertising, [copypastas](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=copypasta) and false PSAs. We also do not permit trolling of any kind in our community.

## NSFW
Do not use vulgar language excessively. Do not post any messages that contain content that is NSFW. NSFW content includes, but is not limited to, pornography, violence and other distributing or objectionable content. Content that is prohibited by the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) is strictly forbidden in our community.

## Contacting Staff
If you have a question for staff, please use the server to communicate with them. Do not send a direct message to staff unless they ask you to do so. If you find a security issue with our bots or website, please report it to us responsibly. Security vulnerabilities may be sent to us by email at security@typicalbot.com.
